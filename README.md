# devsecops-api-script
---
This script is designed to manipulate the APIs for the services stood up for the DevSecOps on OpenShift Container Platform 4 workshop.

It exposes several classes to manipulate those APIs with functions to manipulate the APIs using a context manager.

Additionally, there is a CLI based on `click` that helps to manipulate these APIs from the command line.
